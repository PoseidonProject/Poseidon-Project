Poseidon Project - Open Source Project Management
-------------------------------------------------
EXPERIMENTAL BRANCH
-------------------------------------------------
Version: A04
-------------------------------------------------

Changelog:

A04:

Alpha Release 04 introduces the basis of a new
dynamic styling system. All styles are now 
retrieved from central files in the /style directory
of Poseidon.

AO3:

Alpha Release 03 features a number of significant 
and fundamental features. A login system has been 
implemented, complete with logout, login page, and 
checks to see if a user is logged in. 

The first incarnation of the dashboard has arrived. 
This will be the first page the user visits when they 
login. Currently the dashboard features a minimalistic 
design. Confirming the user is logged in, and providing a 
logout button. Eventually this page will give an overview
of projects and due tasks. A favicon has also been added.

Several new debug functions have been introduced:

 - Test Session
 - Test Settings
 - Test Encryption
 - Test Hash
 
The test session functions displays session variables,
should they be stored. The settings test displays settings
from the Poseidon configuration file. Test encryption encrypts
samplee data from get variables in the URL. Test hash generates
a random 56 character salt.

New bugfixes have been introduced. Mainly minor fixes throughout
the code, and introduction of missing 'session_start()' functions.

This release still release heavily on debugged code, as seen throughout
the project. Currently there is no database dump available. This will be
included in the next alpha release.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

All configuration values need to be manually entered in the following files:

 - inc/database.settings.php
 - inc/configuration.settings.php

Currently no database dump is available.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please report any bugs you find in the Poseidon code.

It is not recommended that you run code from this
branch on production servers due to the possibility
of security flaws, general operation bugs, and the
likelyhood that debug code is still present in the
application.

It is also possible that security measures used
by stable releases of Poseidon have been disabled
in some experimental builds for testing purposes.

All experimental branch builds also include a
directory not present in stable and production
builds: 'debug'. 

This directory contains functions that allow 
the testing of new features with ease. However,
these testing functions are not guaranteed to be
protected or secured in any way.

For the reasons stated above, we insist that for 
production servers and distribution you switch to
the master branch.

Thankyou.
