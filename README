Poseidon Project - Open Source Project Management
-------------------------------------------------
EXPERIMENTAL BRANCH
-------------------------------------------------
Version: A01
-------------------------------------------------

It is not recommended that you run code from this
branch on production servers due to the possibility
of security flaws, general operation bugs, and the
likelyhood that debug code is still present in the
application.

It is also possible that security measures used
by stable releases of Poseidon have been disabled
in some experimental builds for testing purposes.

All experimental branch builds also include a
directory not present in stable and production
builds: 'debug'. 

This directory contains functions that allow 
the testing of new features with ease. However,
these testing functions are not guaranteed to be
protected or secured in any way.

For the reasons stated above, we insist that for 
production servers and distribution you switch to
the master branch.

Thankyou.
